# Frontend Mentor - Four card feature section

To develop this design I used grid to align the card and inside the card I used flex. And align items by basic margins and padding.

This is my first time using grid layout and it is pretty fast and easy. But still find flex useful inside the card because thats one directional.

Hope you find this project close to the desgin.
